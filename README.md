3. **📦 ARTIFACT REGISTRY** - Secure image storage in Amazon ECR with versioning
4. **🚀 ZERO-DOWNTIME DEPLOY** - ECS Fargate blue-green deployment strategy

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Microservices-Ready**: Containerized application architecture
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Serverless compute with AWS Fargate
- **Security-First**: Private container registry and IAM-based access control
- **Cost-Optimized**: Pay-per-use serverless infrastructure
